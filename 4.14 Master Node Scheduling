Step 1 Set the master node to MasterOnly.
[root@k8smaster1 scheduler]# kubectl taint node k8smaster3 noderole.kubernetes.io/master="":NoSchedule


kubectl describe nodes k8smaster3


Step 2 Create a test pod.
Create a node label to ensure that the pod is scheduled to the specified node.
[root@k8smaster1 scheduler]# kubectl label nodes k8smaster3 class=b
Create a pod.
[root@k8smaster1 scheduler]# cat > master-pod.yaml <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: master-pod
spec:
 containers:
 - name: master-pod
 image: nginx
 imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
 nodeSelector:
 class: b
EOF
[root@k8smaster1 scheduler]# kubectl apply -f master-pod.yaml
Check the node scheduling status. Only k8smaster3 has the class:b label and has been
marked as MasterOnly. In this case, the pod can only be pending.
kubectl get pods -o wide


Step 3 Mark the master node as schedulable.
[root@k8smaster1 scheduler]# kubectl taint node k8smaster3 node-role.kubernetes.io/masterVerify that the pod has been scheduled to k8smaster3 and is running properly.

kubectl get pods -o wide


Step 4 Delete the test pod.
[root@k8smaster1 scheduler]# kubectl delete pods master-pod
