Step 1 Mark a node as unschedulable.
[root@k8smaster1 scheduler]# kubectl cordon k8snode1
Check the setting.
kubectl describe nodes k8snode1

kubectl gert nodes

Step 2 Create a test pod.
Create a pod.
[root@k8smaster1 scheduler]# cat > cordon-pod.yaml <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: cordon-pod
spec:
 containers:
 - name: cordon-pod
 image: nginx
 imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
 nodeSelector:
 class: a
EOF
[root@k8smaster1 scheduler]# kubectl apply -f cordon-pod.yaml
Check the node scheduling status. Only k8snode1 has the class:a label and has been
marked as unschedulable. In this case, the pod can only be pending.
kubectl get pods -o wide


Step 3 Mark a node as schedulable.
[root@k8smaster1 scheduler]# kubectl uncordon k8snode1

Verify that the pod can be scheduled properly.

kubectl get pods -o wide

Step 4 Force a node to evict a pod.
Evict the pod from k8snode1.
[root@k8smaster1 scheduler]# kubectl drain k8snode1 --ignore-daemonsets --force


Check the node status.
kubectl get nodes

Verify that the pod has been evicted from k8snode1.
kubectl get pods -o wide | grep k8snode1

Mark the node as schedulable.
[root@k8smaster1 scheduler]# kubectl uncordon k8snode1
